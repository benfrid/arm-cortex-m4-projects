# ARM Cortex-M4 experiments
This repository contains hobby projects built on TM4C123 Tiva LaunchPad from Texas Instruments which mounts the ARM cortex M4 processor

## Description
The Cortex-M4 processor is developed to address digital signal control projects that demand an efficient, easy-to-use blend of control and signal processing capabilities. The combination of high-efficiency signal processing functionality with the low-power, low cost and ease-of-use benefits of the Cortex-M family of processors satisfies many markets. These industries include motor control, automotive, power management, embedded audio and industrial automation domains.

## Experiments
The experiments were on real-world projects solved using Embedded systems. C programming language was used to program the microcontroller. The project difficulty varies from beginner to an intermediate level including designing interfaces, state machines, logic analyzers and I/O controllers.

1. `Flashing LED` -  Uses simple programming structures in C to flash an LED
2. `M4 square shaped room` - This program calculates area of a square shaped room
3. `SOS` - Program to flash SOS using clock cycle delays
4. `Switch toggle` - Program to turn ON/OFF LED using external switch
5. `Traffic Light` - Index implementation of a Moore finite state machine to operate a traffic light
6. `Tuning Fork Note` - Program that uses SysTick interrupts to create a squarewave at 440Hz
7. `UART` - Test implementation of UART for 115200 baud rate
